This privacy policy outlines how WiLO Networks Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”) manages information in relation to your use of this mobile application. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users and aim to provide transparency regarding how information is handled. By using the application, you acknowledge and accept the terms outlined in this document.

This application is designed to operate using only the information necessary to support its core functionality. Any data provided by users during their interaction with the application is used exclusively to enable its intended features and is not repurposed for any unrelated purposes. The application does not request or collect personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, or contact details. The information associated with usage is limited to what is required to facilitate communication between the application and the systems that support its operation. The application does not monitor background activity or collect behavioral information beyond what is essential for direct user interaction with its features.

Communication between the application and its supporting systems is conducted solely for the purpose of enabling the technical operation of the features accessed by the user. These interactions remain limited in scope to supporting specific functions within the application and are not employed to generate personal profiles or to associate activity with identifiable individuals. The information exchanged is restricted to what is necessary to support the specific functions performed within the application.

To support the application's functionality and maintain consistent operation, we may engage external service providers to assist with specific tasks. These providers operate exclusively under our direction and are engaged solely to support responsibilities defined by us that contribute to the application's performance. They do not participate in the application's design, content, or decision-making processes. Furthermore, they are not permitted to use, retain, or disclose any information beyond what is strictly required to fulfill their assigned functions. Their involvement is governed by formal agreements that align with the limited purpose of their role and the operational needs of the application.

Information associated with application usage may be retained to the extent necessary to maintain consistent functionality over time. This may include persistent data required to ensure stable operation and to support the application's ability to respond reliably to user interactions. Such data is maintained in secure, access-controlled environments and is preserved solely for purposes directly related to the technical operation of the application. We do not share or disclose this information outside our organization, and its use is strictly confined to internal support and operational purposes.

This application is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If we become aware that data has been provided by a child under 13, we will promptly remove it. Parents or guardians who believe a child has used the application and submitted information are encouraged to contact us directly so that appropriate action can be taken.

Users may contact us at any time with questions about the handling of data associated with the application. Requests for access, correction, or deletion of information will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe. We are committed to providing clear responses to any concerns related to data usage or privacy.

This privacy policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in functionality or compliance requirements. When revisions are made, the “Last Updated” date at the top of this document will be updated accordingly. We encourage users to review this policy from time to time to stay informed about how information is managed in connection with the application.
